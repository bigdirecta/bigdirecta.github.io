        I’m Theodore, an artist working across the disciplines of photography, videography and design.
    </p>

    <p class="work-text">

        I began adult life with a Bachelor’s of Creative Writing, and since then have followed a meandering path by way
        of freelancing to undertaking my Honours year of Fine Arts at Monash University in 2024.
    </p>

    <p class="work-text">
        I take photos and videos of all sorts of people – mostly in music, and make social media and website content for
        companies. I design artwork for music releases, and create visual designs for video accompaniments to tracks, as
        well as live performances.
